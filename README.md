# Welcome to the Nexus Project

> **Note**
> The documentation for this project was written by ChatGPT and curated by [QuiCro](https://github.com/Quicro).

## Overview

The Nexus Project is a flexible and scalable .NET-based application designed to provide abstraction layers for both frontend and backend components. By leveraging .NET 8.0 and Entity Framework, Nexus offers a solution that is independent of specific technologies such as Avalonia, ASP.NET, Windows Forms, or particular databases. This allows developers to focus on building applications without being constrained by the underlying technologies.

Inspired by the customization capabilities of Minecraft resource packs, Nexus aims to bring the same level of flexibility and automation to application development. With a robust architecture, role-based access control, and the ability to automatically generate user interfaces from database schemas, Nexus stands out as a powerful tool for modern software engineering.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following software installed:

- **Visual Studio 2022** (or later)
- **.NET SDK** (version compatible with the project)
- **SQL Server** for database management

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/nexuscore.git
   cd nexuscore
   ```

2. **Open the solution:**

   Open the `NexusCore.sln` file in Visual Studio.

3. **Restore NuGet packages:**

   In Visual Studio, navigate to `Tools` > `NuGet Package Manager` > `Package Manager Console` and run:

   ```sh
   Update-Package -reinstall
   ```

4. **Build the solution:**

   Build the solution to ensure all dependencies are properly installed and the project compiles successfully.

### Quick Start Guide

1. **Configure the database:**

   Update the connection string in the `appsettings.json` file to point to your SQL Server instance.

2. **Apply migrations:**

   Open the Package Manager Console and run the following commands to apply migrations and create the database schema:

   ```sh
   Update-Database
   ```

3. **Run the application:**

   Press `F5` in Visual Studio to start debugging and run the application.

## Architecture

### Core Components

NexusCore is built on a set of core components that provide the foundation for data management, user interface interactions, and extensibility. These components include:

- **NexusEF.Models:** Defines the data models and entity framework configurations.
- **NexusCore.Interfaces:** Contains the interfaces that define the contracts for various components.
- **NexusCore.Logging:** Provides logging functionality to track and record system events and errors.
- **NexusCore.Helpers:** Utility classes and methods to assist with common tasks.

### Controllers

Controllers are the backbone of NexusCore, managing the flow of data and interactions between the user interface and the underlying data models. Key controllers include:

- **MainController:** The primary controller that coordinates overall application behavior.
- **EditorController:** Manages the editing of data entities.
- **ViewerController:** Handles the presentation and viewing of data entities.

### Forms and User Controls

NexusCore provides a set of forms and user controls to create a rich user interface:

- **BigForms:** Contains the main forms used in the application, such as `NexusMDIForm`.
- **BigControls:** Includes various user controls like `EditorUserControl` and `ViewerUserControl`.

## Features

### Data Management

NexusCore uses Entity Framework for data management, providing a robust and flexible way to interact with the database. It supports CRUD operations, complex queries, and data relationships.

### Logging

The logging system in NexusCore captures and records events, errors, and other significant actions within the application. This helps in monitoring the applicationâ€™s behavior and diagnosing issues.

### Extensibility

NexusCore is designed to be highly extensible. Developers can easily add new features, extend existing functionalities, and integrate third-party libraries to meet specific requirements.

---

## Usage Examples

- **Example 1:** Basic CRUD operations using Entity Framework.
- **Example 2:** Customizing the user interface with BigForms and BigControls.
- **Example 3:** Implementing new controllers and integrating them with the existing architecture.
